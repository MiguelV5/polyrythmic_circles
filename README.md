# Polyrythmic Circles

This is a simple static webpage featuring the polyrhythmic spiral effect.

The page was heavily inspired by the work of both @project_jdm and @Hyperplexed on YouTube.
It's mainly based from the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GaGnU8Ij2Y).

It was created with vanilla js applied on a html canvas, the credit for the initial script's skeleton goes to @Hyperplexed, I heavily modified it afterwards for better structuring, some QoL UI additions and style customization.

The audio assets were made with [SoundTrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/home/). 

As for a brief explaination of the concept of polyrythms:

> *Imagine you have N amount of people clapping their hands. One person claps twice every second, like a steady heartbeat. Other person claps three times every second, and so on. Even though they are clapping at different speeds, if they start at the same time, sometimes they will clap in sync, sometimes their claps will be slightly off from each other. This difference in timing creates a polyrhythmic pattern. You might hear a regular pattern emerging from time to time but it will be rather intricate and multilayered.*
