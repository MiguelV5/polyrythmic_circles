# Polyrythmic Circles

This is a simple static webpage featuring the polyrhythmic spiral effect.

The page was heavily inspired by the work of both @project_jdm and @Hyperplexed on YouTube.
It's mainly based from the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GaGnU8Ij2Y).

It was created with vanilla js applied on a html canvas, the credit for the initial script's skeleton goes to @Hyperplexed, I heavily modified it afterwards for better structuring, some QoL UI additions and style customization.

The audio assets are generated with [SoundTrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/home/).
