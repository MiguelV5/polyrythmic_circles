# Polyrythmic Circles

The polyrhythmic spiral effect page was heavily inspired by the work of both @project_jdm and @Hyperplexed on YouTube.
  
It was created with vanilla js for the canvas.
It's mainly based from the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GaGnU8Ij2Y), and customized for a different visualization afterwards.

There are some interesting parameters to tinker around i.e. start time, total duration, number of cycles, etc.
  
I also did not know a good way to get instrument sound effects, in particular multiple octaves as needed, so I made my own on SoundTrap using the vibraphone. 
  
If you want to get your hands dirty you can go ahead and fork it. 
Altough you might want to be careful messing with the default audio volume, I almost went deaf a few times lol.
  
I didn't know what polyrhythms were before seeing their content so I asked ChatGPT out of curiosity for an ELI5 definition since I wanted to get the basics only.


Here is the answer I liked the most:

> *Imagine you have two people clapping their hands. One person claps twice every second, like a steady heartbeat: clap, clap, clap, clap. The other person claps three times every second: clap, clap, clap. Even though they are clapping at different speeds, if they start clapping at the same time, you'll notice something interesting. After a little while, their claps won't line up exactly together. Sometimes they will clap at the same time, sometimes their claps will be slightly off from each other. This difference in timing creates a polyrhythmic pattern. It's like two rhythms happening at the same time but not perfectly synchronized. You might hear a regular pattern emerging from their claps, but it won't be a simple, predictable rhythm like a steady beat. It becomes more intricate and layered because of the different clapping speeds. So, in short, a polyrhythmic pattern is when two or more rhythms or beats are played at the same time, but each rhythm has its own unique speed or timing, creating a more complex and interesting musical pattern.*
