# Polyrythmic Circles

This is a simple static webpage featuring the polyrhythmic spiral effect.

The page was heavily inspired by the work of both @project_jdm and @Hyperplexed on YouTube.

It was created with vanilla js applied on a canvas.

It's mainly based from the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GaGnU8Ij2Y), and customized for a different visualization afterwards.

I also did not know a good way to get instrument sound effects, in particular multiple octaves as needed, so the ones I used are made on [SoundTrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/home/) using the vibraphone. 

I didn't know what polyrhythms were before seeing their content so I asked ChatGPT out of curiosity for an ELI5 definition.
Here is the answer I liked the most:

> *Imagine you have two people clapping their hands. One person claps twice every second, like a steady heartbeat. The other person claps three times every second. Even though they are clapping at different speeds, if they start at the same time, you'll notice that after a little while their claps won't line up exactly together. Sometimes they will clap at the same time, sometimes their claps will be slightly off from each other. This difference in timing creates a polyrhythmic pattern. It's like two rhythms happening at the same time but not perfectly synchronized. You might hear a regular pattern emerging from their claps, but it won't be a simple, predictable rhythm like a steady beat. It becomes more intricate and layered because of the different speeds, thus creating an interesting pattern.*
